Welcome to BCG’s virtual experience program! We’re so excited to have you here with us!

So what exactly is a virtual experience program? It is the perfect opportunity to take on practical tasks similar to what our very own BCGers would work on and get a true feel of what it is like to work at BCG as a strategy consultant, technology consultant, and a designer which will give you deeper understanding on what BCG does and help set you up for success when you decide to apply with us.

BCG partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities. Our diverse, global teams bring deep industry and functional expertise and a range of perspectives to spark impactful change through leading-edge management consulting as well as data science, technology and design, digital ventures, and business purpose. We work in a uniquely collaborative model across the firm and throughout all levels of the client organization to deliver results that help our clients thrive.

In this virtual experience program, you will gain enviable insight into what it’s like to solve meaningful challenges with our diverse and forward-thinking team. What’s great about our virtual experience program is the flexibility of it. You’ll get to choose the module or modules that you would like to take and complete all of these tasks and modules anywhere and anytime in the world, allowing you to upskill yourself in your own time and pace.

After finishing each module, you’ll be provided with real work sample answers from our leaders and you can see how top-tier consultants and our designers would have tackled each task, so that you can learn from their approach.
